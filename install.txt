How to install Yubikey
======================

Yubikey is installed as a regular ImpressCMS module, which means you should copy the complete /yubikey folder into the /modules directory of your website. Then, log in to your site as administrator, go to System Admin > Modules, look for the Yubikey icon in the list of uninstalled modules and click in the install icon. Follow the directions in the screen and you'll be ready to go.

Requirements
============
1. This version of the Yubikey module is specific to ImpressCMS 1.3.x series (a version for the 1.2.x is also available). Do not install it on V2.0.
2. You need a Yubikey hardware token, they cost $25. You can buy these from Yubico http://yubico.com/. Do not buy them from a reseller. Sometimes you can find promotional codes online.
3. Your server must have cURL installed.
4. You must get a Client ID and API key from the Yubikey website (see below). The module will not work until you do (see set up, below).
5. A MANUAL is available in the /extras folder, or via a link in the control panel. DO NOT USE THIS MODULE UNTIL YOU HAVE READ IT.

Set up
======
To operate the module you need to obtain a Yubikey client ID and secret API key from https://upgrade.yubico.com/getapikey/. This information must be entered in the module preferences. Only then will you be able to authenticate keys against the Yubico validation server.
